Sixty years ago, it ultimately chose slavery over the freedom promised by the American union, just like much of the south. Virginia must either choose to chart a new course among the changing tide, or continue the path that kept so profitable for two hundred years." 

dwf_recommended_name_ILL:0 "#v Illinois Country#!"
dwf_recommended_desc_ILL:0 "Illinois stares right into the face of the Frontier, heading west towards the coveted lands around the Great Lakes. Tensions rise between the settlers and the Indians... And the Canadians... And the Louisianans. Illinois must be careful on this frontier with the Indian Confederacy, as it continues to retrace the path to the frontier of a United America.

The Northern states are helping to agitate for the freedom of slaves. Combined with the rising sentiment for American freedom and the freedom of slaves. Georgia must tread carefully to balance the profits of the blood-stained cotton cash crops, and its destiny to reclaim its freedom."

dwf_recommended_name_LOU:0 "#v The Republic of Louisiana#!"

Originally colonized to make money by the French, but struggling with debt. Louisiana is a failed state, but Louisiana is beginning to awaken. There is a strong support for democracy in the nation, an effort across the aisle to save the economy, and a destiny to claim its glory over the American continent. Will Louisiana weather the storm, to be able to save the country. and if so, what will emerge from the storm?"

dwf_recommended_name_TEX:0 "#v Republic of Texas#!"
dwf_recommended_desc_TEX:0 "Texas has actively risen up against Mexico for independence, a sign of a rising sentiment for American freedom. The last free American state needs a miracle, if it wishes to survive, and an even larger miracle to be a part of a free America. Will Texas get theirs?"
